# What is SRE - Site Reliability Engineer ?
* What a SRE does: SRE teams are responsible for how code is deployed, configured, and monitored.
* Responsible for:
    * System availability, latency, performance, efficiency, change management, monitoring, emergency response, and capacity planning. 
* Backgrounds in: 
    * Software engineering, system engineering, or system administration.
* A software engineer's approach to IT.
# Are SRE and DevOps the same, if different then how? <img alt="hmmgif" src="https://i.imgur.com/6sQfRb7.gif" width='40' align="right"/>
* DevOps ends at deployment and SRE begins.
DevOps focus: Efficiency of development process
* SRE focus: Safety, health, uptime, and the ability to remedy unforeseen problems
* SRE can be considered an implementation of DevOps.
* DevOps automate deployment, while SRE automates redundancy
* SRE can help DevOps teams whose developers are overwhelmed by operations tasks and need someone with more specialized ops skills.
* Time:
    * SRE was born at Google in 2003
The DevOps movement started between 2007 and 2008. The term was first coined in 2009
* Mentality Differences:
    * Development DevOps are the guys that love writing software. They are writing code and testing it and pushing it out into production to get an application line to help solve a problem.
    * SREs are more investigative. They are willing to do the analysis to find why something has gone wrong. They want to ensure that the same problems donâ€™t keep happening. They want to be proactive in their efforts, not reactive.
